            "education system\n",
            ". These people are now in local government leadership roles and have failed to deliver on promised changes to the education system, leaving the public with false hope.\n",
            "The practical side of the restructuring of the state is still in confusion. All\n",
            "government levels\n",
            "have access to the policy formulation and implementation for bringing change in the country. However, the provincial governments, which are directly related to the federal government at the centre, are as confused as crows in fogs.\n",
            "Even now, a clear blueprint has not been prepared regarding what/how much the local government can do and what it cannot do. Regarding the education system, the 2015 constitution of Nepal has stated that education up to the secondary level is under the responsibility of the local government. In this regard, the Act does not seem to be mentioned in the law.\n",
            "The rules and laws related to various thematic areas provided by the constitution have not been formulated. Therefore, in such a situation, the central, provincial and local governments cannot advance the education system by prioritising it in a coordinated manner.\n",
            "Our constitution recognises education as a fundamental right. Free and compulsory basic education has also been taken as a natural right of citizens. There is a need for effective implementation of provisions and laws related to compulsory education. Our constitution has also divided the rights of primary and secondary education into a list of single rights at the local level.\n",
            "The federal law has to do according to the constitution while distributing the rights of education. This Act should clearly define the role of which level of government is responsible for bringing change in the system. The government does not seem to be serious about the current issue of education. In particular, no attention has been paid to bridging the gap created between government and private schools. Arbitrary fee collection in schools is very much discussed. No matter how much we talk, both private and public schools should agree to improve education.\n",
            "As education and health are the basic needs of every citizen, it is the responsibility of the nation to fulfil them. The government has not become sensitive about the many evils that are piling up in the education and health sectors.\n",
            "Economically weak citizens can neither seek treatment nor get quality education. Managers in education and health resorted to money-making get-rich-overnight schemes. The feeling of serving the people is nowhere to be found. In slogans, and speeches, leaders boast that they are for the people, but that is just pretence.\n",
            "Politics is the root of all kinds of distortions that have appeared in our country now. The country cannot prosper until the increasing criminalisation in this area is stopped. For this, it is necessary to immediately improve the integrity and administrative capacity of the political leadership. Also, the local government should be made fully responsible by understanding the spirit of the region.\n",
            "Article 39 of the Constitution of Nepal mentions that each child should be provided with proper education and health by the family and the state, as well as the right to nurture, care, sports, entertainment, etc., and the right to personality development.\n",
            "It is necessary for the local government that holds the reins of education to take the initiative in this regard as soon as possible. For this, the\n",
            "Federal Education Act\n",
            "had to come soon and the local government also needs to be more knowledgeable in the matter of education.\n",
            "Along with federalism, education up to the secondary level has come to be under the local government according to Article 57 (4) Schedule 8 of the Constitution. Keeping this in mind, complaints have started to increase when the local level makes education regulations and takes action against teachers in some places. It seems that the local level should not be more ambitious. Legal validity must be taken into account. Responsible education should act impartially without prejudice.\n",
            "The local government must be empowered and decisive, but the tendency to make decisions without considering the legality while making decisions may cause disaffection towards the local government.\n",
            "At present, although the necessary competence and capability of the teaching service of the teachers is seen to some extent, the morale is declining due to various political activities.\n",
            "The government does not seem to have taken the necessary initiatives to raise morale. Morale should not be reduced by scolding the teacher. If the teacher is not enthusiastic, there will be no positive results in education.\n",
            "No matter how good an education policy is made, without good delivery by teachers, its implementation may fail. Therefore, having teachers and teaching services is a mandatory requirement for quality education. While making the rules and laws regarding the conditions of teaching, it is necessary to take into consideration the shortcomings of the past.\n",
            "The problem in the education system is not the lack of suggestions for laws and regulations. But it is the lack of political commitment to regulate the policies, the laxity of implementation of unreasonable policies and rules, the lack of awareness among parents about education and teachers are also indifferent to their work. If it is not resolved in time, the education sector will become more chaotic. Provincial and local governments must also act in terms of accountability in the future.\n",
            "The federal government should not make local laws/regulations without consulting the provincial and local governments. The centre must recognise the existence of provinces and localities as autonomous governments.\n",

            ", commonly known as rock carvings, have been created during prehistoric and early historic times. These serve as crucial documents representing the cultural makeup, physical environment, social compulsion, and economic activities of the period when they were made. These sites are quintessential for comprehending not just our ancestors but also the entire civilization of mankind.\n",
            "In Nepal, petroglyph sites are rare, with only a few rock art sites identified in the Nepali Himalayas. The first petroglyphs were\n",
            "discovered in 1993 by the team of the German Research Council (DFG)\n",
            "Focus Program ‘Tibet-Himalayas’ at the Kak (Kag) Nyimba site, located near the present settlement of Eklae Bhati.\n",
            "The same team found two other petroglyph sites in Samar and Te (Tsuk?) in 1995, all in the lower region of Mustang. In later years, between 2013 and 2017, I discovered three more sites with rock paintings and rock carvings in Dhetang, Shar-ri region of Lo (\n",
            "Upper Mustang\n",
            "). It is worth noting that another rock art site is said to exist outside of Mustang in Nepal, but its whereabouts and contents have not been independently verified.\n",
            "Kag Nyimba, also pronounced as Kak Nyimba, is the very first rock engraving site discovered in Nepal by a team of DFG researchers in 1993. The site was discovered accidentally while the team was studying the nearby abandoned settlement called Kag Nyimba (2,270 m), which is also the namesake of the petroglyph site. The site is situated in the Kali Gandaki Valley, located approximately two kilometres south of Kagbeni Village. The engraved rock fragments are mostly located on the riverbed of the Kali Gandaki River.\n",
            "The engravings at Kag Nyimba were created using primitive tools such as simple stones chisels and other primitive tools. The DFG Team working closely, led by Perdita Pohle identified over 1,200 engravings that are spread out across two large areas of rock that are approximately 200 metres apart. The findings of which were published in separate volumes in 2000 and 2001.\n",
            "The engravings were created over different periods and feature various motifs, including footprints, handprints, circles, semi-circles, flowers, horses, spirals, human figures, and more. Additionally, there are carvings of animals such as yaks, wild yaks, blue sheep, dogs, deer, and cattle-like figures. The site also has engravings of various symbols, including Buddhist and pre-Buddhist symbols, axes, and other tools, as well as cup marks, labyrinths, and geometric signs in various sizes and positions.\n",
            "The petroglyphs found in the Kag Nyimba sites are believed to have been created during various epochs, spanning from the pre-historic to the historic period. However, it is not possible to determine their exact age just by studying the images themselves.\n",
            "According to the research conducted by Perdita Pohle and Willibald Haffner from DFG, as well as the research carried out by Prakash Darnal and I preliminary research, some of the carvings can be traced back to prehistoric periods such as the Neolithic Period (approximately 10,000 BCE) and others to the Iron Age (between approximately 1,500 BCE and 500 BCE).\n",
            "Some images can also be linked to historical periods, mostly from the 11th to 15th century, but a few could also date back to the pre-7th century. The presence of engravings with Buddhist and pre-Buddhist inscriptions makes it easier to assume that these engravings are from the recent past. It is also safe to assume that all these images are connected to the present and past indigenous communities of the region. They are essential relics of the past epochs that provide evidence of the lifestyle, belief system, and way of life of our ancestors.\n",
            "The negligence of the local authorities has led to the destruction of this significant cultural heritage site of Kag Nyimba. In an attempt to prevent water flow from directly hitting the rock surface with engravings, the authorities constructed a concrete wall. Unfortunately, this decision resulted in a disaster as the contractor poured cement mortar all over the engravings, destroying hundreds of engravings that were thousands of years old.\n",
            "Additionally, the use of heavy machinery and a crawler dozer partially broke and damaged some art panels. Consequently, the Kag Nyimba petroglyph site now lies in tatters. More than half of the previously reported engravings have been damaged and discarded, while some have disappeared and are unaccounted for. The concrete barrage that was built to protect the site is also not fully functional. The water flow from the Kali Gandaki is gradually destroying the engravings as the art panels are still exposed to the direct flow of water.\n",
            "How the local authorities and the Department of Archaeology in Nepal approved and executed the construction work that destroyed the Kag Nyimba heritage site is incomprehensible. All parties involved should be held responsible for the physical destruction of this site that is thousands of years old.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is unacceptable that such sites are destroyed for the benefit of a select few. The construction work was carried out without proper monitoring in a fragile and sensitive area, which is unforgivable.\n",
            "This site could very well be a sacred site, a place of ritual gatherings, or a cremation ground. This incident has raised questions about the competency of the Department of Archaeology, which is responsible for protecting and preserving such sites.\n",
            "The department must be held accountable and answer for what went wrong at Kag Nyimba so that such negligence does not happen again.\n",
            "Unfortunately, the damage to Kag Nyimba is irreversible, but we must work to protect the remaining petroglyph sites in Mustang before they too are lost forever. Immediate action must be taken by the authorities to rectify the damage and prevent further destruction of the remaining engravings at the site.\n",

            "Essentially, a target person’s images and videos are fed as inputs into the GANs model. The generator AI creates fabricated footage trying to accurately imitate the source. Meanwhile, the discriminator AI compares outputs with real footage to catch flaws.\n",
            "This cycle repeats endless times – slowly enhancing the quality of a digital imitation game. Over time, the neural networks assimilate nuances like exact lip movements, micro-expressions, skin blemishes, pulse rate, hoarseness or sneezes.\n",
            "With enough data and processing power, synthesised footage eventually matches real video’s richness and idiosyncrasies. While today’s fakes may still seem slightly off, computer vision capacities are likely to bridge this gap soon.\n",
            "While the current technology permits partial face replacement, future models could conjure fully AI-rendered humans indistinguishable from reality. Labels like ‘shallowfakes’ and ‘cheapfakes’ refer to simpler edits using existing imagery and apps to alter context.\n",
            "These allow manipulating political speeches, humour dolls, and putting words in someone’s mouth without needing advanced techniques. Experts compare the democratised ability to doctor reality today as equivalent to early basic Photoshop filters in the 1990s progressing to advanced manipulations like puppets mastering motion and expressions using deep learning in the 2020s. The arms race between falsification and detection capabilities is only warming up.\n",
            "Since the first deepfake algorithm emerged in 2017\n",
            "to swap celebrity faces into porn videos, the field has advanced rapidly from niche academic interest to mainstream applications. Last year, a Russian startup created a realistic deepfake of Elon Musk in a custom three-minute video that fooled many.\n",
            "The ease of use around such ‘puppeteering’ of public figures to spread fake news poses huge risks. Meanwhile, apps like Reface, Zao and FaceSwap allow anyone to insert their or their friends’ faces onto existing videos and gifs with little effort.\n",
            "Leading developers can now synthesise near photo-realistic digital humans like the one anchored by Disney for its Mandalorian series. Students with access to code and data create compelling deepfakes as class projects.\n",
            "Specialised firms helping politicians ‘resurrect’ deceased leaders in synthetic speeches during events highlight the commercial side. The Indian government even plans to build a public database to aid the country’s world-leading face recognition industry and enable consent-based deepfakes.\n",
            "The costs, computing power and AI skills required to generate convincing deepfakes have shrunk dramatically since 2017. Generator algorithms have grown over 200 times faster in 18 months reflecting swelling interest and investments.\n",
            "Where only Hollywood-grade software could create decent deepfakes earlier, free consumer apps now suffice. Manipulating footage to alter context no longer needs advanced techniques, as apps like Impressions Kit allow spoofing humour dolls to mimic anyone’s body language.\n",
            "Experts describe the field as having moved from a ‘benchtop to desktop’ scale in ease of access. Machine learning continues to exponentially enhance visual, vocal and behavioural realism in coordination with the data used. We stand at the cusp of synthesised content becoming indistinguishable from reality before the end of this decade to most viewers. Only better forensic authentication standards can catch up in this classic hare and tortoise chase.\n",
            "Despite low digital literacy, Nepal has seen rapid growth in internet access fueled by mobile penetration and social media frenzy. About 65 per cent have internet access today, up from a mere 15 per cent in 2010.\n",
            "On average, a Nepali spends close to seven hours per day on the mobile internet as per Nepal Telecom data. But digital literacy and the ability to authenticate sources before sharing sensational clips rarely keep up with this rapid technological transformation, especially for a demographic where Facebook and TikTok constitute an ‘entire internet’ experience.\n",
            "Our vulnerability is particularly high around elections which see heightened misinformation every cycle. Meanwhile, deepfake apps now allow users to generate pretty realistic footage without advanced knowledge. Soon anyone with a smartphone could ‘hack reality’ to malign political candidates before elections.\n",
            "Even if eventually debunked, first impressions stick strongest. With experts confirming no reliable way currently to fully authenticate videos, the risk of manipulated content triggering unrest remains real – whether elections, racial tensions or other conflicts are amplified manifold through social media echo chambers. Believable fakes risk eroding the last vestiges of truth and trust.\n",
            "While over 30 countries introduced anti-deepfake legislation since 2019, Nepal’s policy discourse largely ignores this gathering storm. Beyond research showing deepfakes potentially influencing electoral outcomes, they pose dire data privacy concerns without consent – especially threats of personal attacks, revenge porn, and identity theft among other dangers against unsuspecting individuals.\n",
            "Technologists warn many malicious uses emerge before regulations can catch up. The deluge of\n",

            "Now imagine believable but edited footage depicting leaders, celebrities or ordinary persons going viral across Facebook groups and TikTok or any reel-sharing platform before any fact checker investigates. Our overburdened and under-resourced media ecosystem lacks resources for sophisticated verification to contain potential damage.\n",
            "Solutions will involve individual and collective actions along with policy interventions. Enhancing digital literacy and public awareness campaigns form a first step so internet users do not unwittingly share manipulated footage without basic verification.\n",
            "Just as anti-piracy alerts preceded movies, all media should caution against deepfake possibilities. The government, civil society and tech companies must collaborate urgently against this challenge. While expanded fact-checking capacities help, dedicated cyber security task forces are vital to identify and curb misinformation outbreaks before they go viral.\n",
            "Legally, anti-deep fake penalties introduced by countries like China, South Korea, the USA and the UK offer models to adapt to Nepal’s context to deter malicious usages while enabling innovation. Defining deepfake to cover manipulated audio/video, explicit consent requirements before generating any personal imagery, penalties for non-consensual use and mandatory removals upon complaint offer a good starting point for discourse around regulations.\n",
            "Deepfakes threaten to contaminate the info-environment by eroding the vestiges of truth. Unchecked, believable forgeries risk hijacking policy narratives around divisive issues to serve partisan agendas with severe societal consequences. The health of our democracy hinges upon shared truths and trust in information channels.\n",
            "With both facing global crises today, Nepal needs urgent collective action to secure our digital future against technological threats that manipulate reality. As institutions deliberate guardrails against this ‘post-truth’ horizon, public vigilance against viral trickery forms the first line of defence. Malicious deepfakes bank on the tendency to share sensational content without verification.\n",
            "Just as Covid made mask-wearing a vital habit, pausing to authenticate the media one share could well emerge as the hallmark of a vigilant digital citizen. Our actions online feed the spread of misinformation targeting democratic processes – be it elections or policy discourse. It calls for renewed commitment towards healthy information ecosystems – promoting literacy alongside literacy.\n",
            "The next waves of technological threats bank on eroding public consensus around foundational facts and truths central to shared reality. Securing our democracy begins with securing perceptions against attempts at hacking reality. Both state and citizens need to collaborate urgently against this gathering storm of persuasive fakes usurping video as undisputed evidence.\n",

            "Excerpt:\n",
            "In the American Prometheus, you talk about the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world, do you think your book is relevant to small countries like Nepal which is far off from being a nuclear power any time soon?\n",
            "Yes, absolutely. The book came out in 2005, but the movie by Christopher Nolan has given it a second life and an international following. Here in Nepal, your neighbours India, China and Pakistan indeed have dangerous nuclear weapons.\n",
            "Currently, countries like North Korea, Pakistan, India, Israel, France and England have dangerous weapons. We live in a very dangerous time. I am thankful to Christopher Nolan for making the movie and drawing attention to such an important issue.\n",
            "You were once a journalist and then switched to becoming a biographer. What drew you to biography?\n",
            "Yes, I started as a journalist in South Asia, writing for the Far East Economic Review, a magazine based in Hong Kong. I drifted into biography almost by accident. I decided to write a book and it became a biography. I fell in love with the genre.\n",
            "Biography is the most powerful vehicle for conveying history. History books are okay, but a biography, if written well, can be a page-turner. It’s about one life and we all are curious about one’s life and journey.\n",
            "I argue biography is also the most arduous scholarship because it is an endless quest for facts about another person’s life. I would confess it is almost novelistic.\n",
            "My biography on Robert Oppenheimer is my take on his life but it is written with hundreds of footnotes. Each fact has to have footnotes. Most biographies take at least five years to be completed. But if done well, they became like a novel.\n",
            "Why Oppenheimer? You had a co-author as well. Was he already working on the book and did you tag along? What was the process like?\n",
            "Yes, I just tagged along.\n",
            "Martin J. Sherwin\n",
            "is no longer with us. He died in October 2021, just two weeks after learning Christopher Nolan would finally make a film. Martin started the book in 1980 and he spent 20 years researching. Then he came to me and asked me to join.\n",
            "He has some biographer disease in which you can’t start to write because you know there is always one more archive and interview to be done. But when I joined it turned out as a great collaboration. It still took five years of my time to take the book into publication.\n",
            "What fascinates you about Robert Oppenheimer?\n",
            "Oppie was his nickname and he was a complex person. He was a quantum physicist in his early 20s. We argued in the book that he is a good scientist because he was humanous, and he loved literature and poetry. He loved the poem of T.S Elliot, John Donne. He loved the novel by Ernest Hemingway.  In the late 30s, he became curious about Hindu scripture. He learned Sanskrit so that he could learn\n",

            "I could talk about Robert for hours. He is of course the father of the atomic bomb. But there is more to him than just that.\n",
            "The book and movie do not address the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The movie has not been shown in Japan yet. What do you have to say about it?\n",
            "I think it is about to. It took about seven to eight months. I think there was hesitancy since it carries a sensitive subject. In the book, we described what happened on the ground. We think almost a quarter million died by the two bombs. Most of them were civilians. In the movies, you do not see what happens on the ground. But I think Nolan did something even better in a way because he forced the audience to see Oppenheimer, imagining the destruction of Hiroshima. The movie compelled everyone in the audience to imagine for themselves what happened.\n",

            "New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.\n",
            "Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However,\n",
            "Toyota\n",
            "became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.\n",
            "But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.\n",
            "In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.\n",
            "Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated.\n",
            "The advantages are listed below:\n",
            "The disadvantages are listed below:\n",
            "Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.\n",

            "The start of 2024 has brought some good news, tempered with warnings, for Nepal’s critically endangered gharials, the fish-eating crocodiles with comically bulbous snouts.\n",
            "Officials at Chitwan National Park, the country’s prime habitat for gharials, one of two crocodile species found in Nepal, say their population increased by around 11 per cent compared to the previous year.\n",
            "Park officials counted 265 individual gharials in the Rapti and Narayani rivers that flow through Chitwan, up from 239 the previous year.\n",
            "“This is indeed encouraging news as we concentrate our efforts towards saving the crocodiles,” said Ashish Bashyal, a researcher with the organisation Biodiversity Conservancy Nepal. “While it is nice to celebrate the achievement, we must not forget that the gains could be temporary and the population could decline at any time if threats are not addressed in time.”\n",
            "Bashyal echoed those concerns in a\n",
            "recently published study\n",
            "in the journal\n",
            "Reptiles & Amphibians\n",
            ", which documents the distribution of the crocodiles throughout Chitwan National Park. The study, which looked at\n",
            "gharial populations\n",
            "between 2017 and 2022, found that although the number of crocodiles increased during the period, their population may not be evenly distributed, pointing to various factors that may be deterring them from choosing a certain habitat even when it’s the kind of habitat in which they would thrive.\n",
            "“We conducted annual winter population surveys for gharial in Chitwan between 2017 and 2022, during which we also looked at the availability of riverbanks and basking preferences,” study lead author Bed Bahadur Khadka, from Chitwan National Park’s Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center, said.\n",
            "Gharials, famous for their narrow snouts that balloon into a bulbous tip, once roamed the Ganga River and its tributaries that flow through the plains of Nepal and India. Today, the crocodiles’ range is limited to only a few rivers in the Ganga Basin, with fishing, changes in river flow, infrastructure development, and poaching posing the main threats to the species.\n",
            "As part of the study, Khadka, Bashyal and colleague Phoebe Griffith, from the\n",
            "Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries\n",
            "in Germany, went out on traditional dugout canoes to count gharials on the banks of the Rapti and Narayani rivers. (The section of the latter that runs through India is known as the Gandak.)\n",
            "These rivers form the western and northern boundaries of Chitwan National Park, best known as home to Bengal tigers and greater one-horned rhinos.\n",
            "“We conducted the surveys in winter [December and January] as the gharials come out of the river to bask in the sun,” Bashyal said.\n",
            "Since 1978, Nepal has run a program to raise gharials in captivity and release them to supplement the wild population. As part of the effort, officials in Chitwan and Bardiya national parks collect eggs from riverbanks, provide a suitable environment for them to hatch in, and feed and raise the young ones until their\n",
            "release at around five years of age\n",
            ". The program has been credited with saving the species from going locally extinct in Nepal.\n",
            "Khadka’s team used various statistical techniques to assess gharial abundance (whether the population is increasing or decreasing), encounter rate (the number of gharials observed per kilometre), riverbank characteristics and basking site selection (the possibility that gharials favour a particular type of riverbank).\n",
            "They found that although the population was increasing in the overall river system, growth was much less pronounced on the Narayani than on its tributary, the Rapti. They also found that gharials prefer to bask on sandy riverbanks than on muddy or rocky ones.\n",
            "Although 45 per cent of the banks (in terms of area) of the Narayani can be described as being sandy, and the figure is just 28 per cent for the Rapti, gharial densities were found to be higher on the Rapti, which came as a surprise to the researchers.\n",
            "The figures are backed up by field observations that human disturbances such as sand mining and rock quarrying are more prevalent in the Narayani, which is also bound by a dam downstream in India, compared to the Rapti.\n",
            "“This extraction over multiple years appears to have altered the river flow, diverting more water toward the Eastern Channel of the Narayani,” the study says, adding this may have reduced the suitability of the habitat.\n",
            "“Severe flooding in June 2021 also impacted some habitats in the Narayani,” Khadka added.\n",
            "However, the most pristine gharial habitat and the most stable population, according to the study, was reported in the Baguban-Tribeni stretch of the Narayani.\n",
            "“The stretch represents a special case as this particular section of the river has core national parkland on both banks and human access is exceptionally difficult,” Bashyal said.\n",
            "Besides its inaccessibility, the site is also protected by the fact that sand quarrying is illegal within the park boundaries. Researchers say they believe the area, home to two resident male gharials, retains its residents, who may move back and forth from time to time, as they find an undisturbed area to live in.\n",
            "“The study shows that gharials likely prefer an undisturbed environment for them to live in,” Khadka said. “This has great implications for conservation as we look at the environmental impacts of different kinds of extraction and building of infrastructure.”\n",
            "Another problematic issue related to the population of the gharials in Chitwan is the poor survival rate of juveniles and subadults released under the captive-breeding program, researcher Ranjana Bhatta, who wasn’t involved in the study said. According to the study, between the first and last surveys, 404 gharials were released into the river, but the overall population increased by only 80. The released gharials, Bhatta said, are getting lost in the system.\n",
            "“Either their mortality is pretty high as they are not adapted to living in the wild, or they are washed away downstream to India and can’t swim back,” Bhatta, one of the brains behind the annual\n",
            "Nepal Crocodile Conservation Fair\n",
            ", said.\n",
            "She added this is an issue that needs to be resolved quickly as a lot of resources have been invested in the captive-breeding program.\n",
            "“One possible solution is to release the juveniles as [far] upstream as possible in the Rapti River, where their densities are high,” she said, adding that the population could recover even faster if the released individuals survive into adulthood.\n",

            "The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.\n",

            "“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.\n",
            "Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.\n",
            "Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.\n",

            "“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
            "The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.\n",

            "“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”\n",
            "Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.\n",

            "Since her debut in 2008, expectations have been high for Chhetry to score Nepal’s first century in women’s cricket. But never had Chhetry come close to scoring one. Things, however, changed on Tuesday, as Rubina Chhetry made history by scoring 118 runs off 59 balls against the Maldives in the\n",
            "ACC Women’s Premier Cup\n",

            "When Rubina Chhetry came out to bat on Tuesday, Nepal found themselves struggling at 22 for three. The situation worsened as they slipped to 61 for 4. However, even amidst the loss of wickets, Chhetry remained undeterred, displaying why she is one of Nepal’s best to pick a bat in hand.\n",
            "“I understood I had to be there after Sita and Indu got out. Understanding it was a batting-friendly wicket game further confidence,” she says.\n",
            "By the end of the 12th over, Chhetry was batting on 37 of 31 balls. Understanding the need to make the most of it wicket, she decided to accelerate things hitting Maaha Naseer for 14 and completing her half-century.\n",
            "The next 50 runs however came quickly, 19 balls to be specific.\n",
            "In the 16th over, Chhetry unleashed her attacking prowess by striking Latsha Haleemath for two fours and a six, showcasing her dominance at the crease. Then, in the 18th over, she faced Nabaa Naseem, smashing her for 18 runs, which included three fours and a six, ultimately writing her name in the history books by scoring Nepal’s first century.\n",
            "As Naseem went a little too full, Chhetry elegantly drove the ball towards long off and as the ball went over the boundary, she fell to her knees, perhaps in a moment of relief and sheer joy at achieving such a monumental milestone for herself and her team.\n",
            "I was very emotional. I didn’t have any words at that time and nor do I have them right now,” she says.\n",
            "The captaincy role comes with a multitude of additional responsibilities beyond just personal performance. Captains must not only focus on their own game but also on the collective performance of the entire team and the outcomes they achieve.\n",
            "When a team is not performing well, the captain often bears the brunt of criticism from supporters and well-wishers. As Chhetry’s performance looked to be dwindling, in November, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) decided to remove her from the captaincy, passing the responsibility to Indu Burma.\n",
            "Coincidentally, this change seemed to have a positive impact on Chhetry, as she has been observed to be in a better rhythm since relinquishing the captaincy role.\n",
            "She was superb during the Prime Minister’s Cup Women’s T20 national tournament where she took Koshi Province to the final. In 10 matches in the competition, she scored 345 runs, including three half-centuries, and also contributed with the ball by taking 11 wickets.\n",
            "Even though she is no longer the captain, Rubina Chhetry believes she has not felt the difference as she continues to lead the team as a senior member and understands her responsibility when she puts on Nepal’s jersey to play cricket.\n",
            "“You have to perform regardless. Me and Sita are senior members of the team and continue to be leaders. We know we have to help Indu,” she says.\n",
            "Rubina Chhetry credits her improved performance to a renewed focus on fitness. She believes that prioritising physical conditioning has contributed significantly to her enhanced abilities on the field.\n",

However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.\n",

            "Ministry of Communication and Information Technology\n",
            "issued a draft of Film Screening Procedure 2024. The draft, however, is receiving flak, especially from individuals of the film fraternity for being against creativity and freedom of expression.\n",
            "The draft of the Film Screening Procedure comprises 17 rules, with rule number 4 being the most contentious. Rule 4 of the draft, which has 20 sub-rules, outlines conditions under which censor certification will not be provided to films.\n",
            "According to Rule 4, a film that jeopardises the peace and security of Nepal, undermines relationships among various religions, casts, genders, and relationships with neighbouring countries, or attempts to show contempt of court will be ineligible for censor certification.\n",
            "Similarly, the rule also prohibits films from depicting scenes of violence against children and animals. Furthermore, it mandates the exclusion of any scenes that offend individuals with disabilities or promote the consumption of drugs and alcohol among the audience.\n",
            "“There should be no scene of rape and nudity,” states the draft. “The film should not encourage unscientific things and should go against the national interest.”\n",
            "Furthermore, the draft of the Film Screening Procedure also prohibits filmmakers from prolonging kissing scenes beyond five seconds and has also mandated the exclusion of scenes and dialogue that could misinterpret national songs, national history, and geographical conditions.\n",
            "After having gone through the draft of the Film Screening Procedure, filmmakers have expressed concerns that if implemented, they will no longer be able to make films in Nepal. They also argue that the rules put on the draft are irrelevant and impractical in the current context, posing a threat to the creativity and artistic freedom of filmmakers.\n",
            "Filmmaker and film critic Samipya Timalsena says that these rules have been made by those who do not have basic film knowledge.\n",
            "“The rules feel like we are in a more dangerous time than the Panchayat era,” says Timalsena.\n",
            "Timalsena suggests that instead of censoring films, a grading system should be implemented. He said if films were graded into different classifications such as adult movies, non-adult movies, religious movies, and others, there would be no need for rules like this. This approach, he said, aligns with the popular global practice and would allow the audience to choose which films they want to watch based on their preferences and age appropriateness.\n",
            "“Why not bring progressive rules instead of censoring a film entirely,” says Timalsena. “In Nepal, the authorities do not see things that way.”\n",
            "Lately, the Nepali government has faced criticism for banning various things. First, the government\n",
            "banned TikTok\n",
            ". Then a few weeks later, it put a ban on protesting in certain areas of Kathmandu including the Matitighar Mandala. Now, with the introduction of the film screening draft that imposes restrictions on filmmakers, further scrutiny and criticism have emerged regarding the government’s stance on limiting creative expression in films.\n",
            "“The government is inclined towards the politics of restriction,” says Shishir Uprety, film educator, who is also a principal at Nepal Film Campus.\n",
            "Uprety further says that the rule included in the draft of Film Screening Procedure 2024 just does not limit the filmmaker’s creativity but also violates the constitutional right of freedom of opinion and expression.\n",
            "Filmmaker and film critic Manoj Pandit has also expressed concern over the draft.\n",
            "“We need to be united and stand against this,” he wrote on social media.\n",
            "Observers say that the rules mentioned in the draft of the Film Screening Procedure will have a major impact on the film sector affecting artistic freedom and creativity. They argue that as Nepali films gain international recognition and reach, implementing such restrictive rules will hinder the growth of the Nepali film industry.\n",
            "They further argue that although authorities attempted to revise the\n",
            "Motion Picture Act 1969\n",
            ", the inclusion of conservative rules undermines the entire effort, potentially stifling creativity and limiting the industry’s progress.\n",
            "“If such a rule comes into implementation, it will kill the creativity of filmmaking. There will be no variation among the films,” says Timalsena. “Only religious films can adopt such rules as they include only good language and no adult scenes.”\n",
            "Uprety also says by introducing such rules the government does not want the public to be aware of their wrongdoings. Uprety specifically points out the sub-rule 6 which prohibits the scene that would offend a person, profession, business or organisation.\n",
            "“This means if any person, profession, business and organisation commits any kind of wrongdoing, we cannot expose them through film just because they would get offended,” he questions.\n",
            "The other rule that has disappointed Uprety is the sub-rule that prohibits the use of double-meaning conversation and visuals.\n",
            "“If this is implemented, the filmmaker will be prevented from using symbols and metaphors, which play a vital role in filmmaking,” says Uprety.\n",
            "Uprety highlights the broader implications of allowing the government to impose censorship on filmmaking, warning that if left unchecked, it could pave the way for similar restrictions in other forms of artistic expression such as writing and painting. Both Uprety and Timalsena argue that the draft reflects a regressive mindset that fails to grasp the importance of artistic and creative freedom. They advocate for the protection of these fundamental rights in the realm of filmmaking and beyond.\n",
            "In response to the criticism the Film Censor Board however held a discussion program with film-related organisations on February 8.  In the meeting, the board asked the film organisations to submit a joint recommendation to the board within a week.\n",
            "The government side says that the misunderstanding about the draft of the Film Screening Procedure has created a controversy.\n",
            "“People have overreacted, they reacted as if these points will be implemented immediately, which was unnecessary,” says Rishi Raj Acharya, a member of the Film Censor Board.  If the government has an ill intention towards the film sector, they would not have called filmmakers for discussion.”\n",
            "However, Acharya also agrees that there is room for improvement in the draft.\n",
            "“There are some nice provisions in the draft but the controversy has overshadowed them,” says Acharya. The draft has tried to promote self-censorship, but it remained unnoticed.”\n",

            "Nepal is a country of diverse ethnicities and all of them have their own art, culture, norms, values and lifestyle. That is not all, they also have their own story of struggles and agony. Among the many ethnicities, Tamang is one of them. This group has its own story of pain and struggles, and Masinya, a play written by Laxmi Rumba, Raju Syangtan, and Rabat, has tried to shed light on it.\n",
            "There is a dearth of plays that are related to the Tamang community.\n",
            "According to reports\n",
            ", plays depicting the Tamang community have been shown in the country only twice before (Mehendo Maya and Sonam Gyalmo). Therefore, Masinya being showcased at Mandala Theatre has become a major hit.\n",
            "As the play begins, it takes us to the world of dhami jhakris, traditional faith healers or ritual practitioners. Nine dhami jhakris are gathered there in a circle, with their leader standing separately, playing the\n",
            "dhyangro\n",
            "and chanting mantras to treat a girl who is experiencing mental distress. The main jhakri begins asking the girl questions about her problems, and she starts to respond. The play then goes back in time.\n",
            "We are introduced to Chyangba, who is busy making a chorten, a stupa-like structure built in memory of someone who has passed away, in an open space. Chyangba is making the chorten in memory of his parents.\n",
            "Soon a conflict arises when Chyanba is told the chorten he built will be destroyed as the local government was building a road near it.\n",
            "Despite there being alternative options for road expansion that would preserve the chorten, the authorities are seen disregarding these alternatives. This initial instance in the play highlights how the rulers have suppressed the traditional sentiments of the indigenous people, including those from the Tamang community, and disrespected their culture.\n",
            "Masinya revolves around various significant concerns of the Tamang community, with the consumption of beef being one of the prominent issues among them.\n",
            "In Nepal, the law prohibits the slaughter of cows; however, it does not explicitly prohibit the consumption of beef. Nevertheless, eating beef remains a controversial topic in Nepal,\n",
            "with people divided in their opinions about it.\n",
            "Masaniya shows the mistreatment faced by the Tamang community simply because they consume beef, a practice they have upheld for centuries. In the play, Chyangba is arrested by the police and is tortured for consuming the meat of a cow that had fallen off a hill. The creators of the play are trying to shed light into a prevalent issue that has grappled the community for years.\n",
            "Masinya, directed by Buddhi Tamang and Sonam Lama, despite focusing on the oppressions faced by the Tamang community, is not solely about sadness, tears, and emotional scenes. The play offers various moments of joy, happiness, and laughter.\n",
            "In the play, Tamang songs with damphu and tugna music make you want to dance. Funny conversations between characters, like Chyangba and his girlfriend, keep the audience laughing non-stop. The humorous conversations between characters like Chyangba and his girlfriend provide comic relief, stimulating continuous laughter from the audience.\n",
            "The gathering of diverse characters engaging in gossip, singing, dancing, and sharing meals creates a local ambience, resembling that of a Tamang village. The lively songs in the play, conceptualised by Sonam Lama, are particularly noteworthy. Special mention must also be made of the live musicians who enhance the overall experience of the play.\n",
            "The lighting in the play is expertly done, adding vibrancy to the scenes. Bal Bahadur Rai, the lighting technician, skillfully uses light to enhance the atmosphere at crucial moments.\n",
            "The traditional setting of the house, the arrangement of utensils used for making jaad (local booze), and conversations in the Tamang accent and language create an authentic feel.\n",
            "While Masinya includes the Tamang language in some parts, those unfamiliar with it may feel momentarily disconnected. However, not understanding the language does not hinder the overall understanding of the play.\n",
            "As the play is focused on the issues of the Tamang community, the play also deserves to be watched by people of various communities.\n",
            "People from the Tamang community can relate to play but people from other communities can learn various new things about the Tamang community, it will give them a new perspective on their culture, lifestyle and struggles.\n",

We must realise that over-reliance on consumption without making productive investments will cause Nepal to miss out on opportunities for industrial growth, as seen in other countries that strategically use diaspora funds. The government must devise and implement targeted policies to capitalise on migrant savings so that remittance money can help drive the country’s enterprise and technology revolution.\n",
            "Currently,\n",
            "more than 90 per cent of remittance spending in Nepal goes towards importing food, clothing, and electronics\n",
            "with little value addition to the larger economy. This type of spending certainly does help families in the short run; however, in the long run, it does not contribute much to economic development. Instead, investing a good portion of the remittance money in other sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, or services could potentially transform the country’s macroeconomics.\n",
            "Furthermore, the large remittances have caused Nepal’s currency to be significantly overvalued compared to India’s currency and\n",
            "hurt Nepal’s export competitiveness\n",
            ". The growing trade deficits have led to a drain of incoming dollars as the country struggles to keep up with the import surge fueled by migrant incomes.\n",
            "Likewise, when the remittance money is continuously utilised only for consumption rather than investment, it\n",
            "creates a cycle of dependencies\n",
            ". It also incentivises\n",
            "young people to leave Nepal for work\n",
            "instead of pursuing education or other entrepreneurial ventures. As we have observed in Nepal for over a decade, this leads to a brain drain and a shortage of skilled labour in the labour market.\n",
            "Therefore, it is crucial to use remittances for production rather than just household consumption to sustain growth and avoid external crises in the long term.\n",
            "Many developing countries have boosted their industrial growth by using diaspora bonds to fund infrastructure projects. Mexico’s famous 3×1 program is a successful initiative that has helped to develop grassroots communities. The\n",

            "have been built using such capital tools,\n",
            "which have improved connectivity and increased private sector productivity. Similarly, telecom, aviation, pharma, and IT giants in emerging Asian economies have also been funded from non-resident community savings.\n",
            "The Philippines has utilized remittances in a variety of ways\n",
            ", such as expanding rural electricity access, which has led to job creation and growth in manufacturing in previously underdeveloped areas. Bangladesh’s government also launched\n",
            "many valuable projects\n",
            "to improve workers’ skills and channel remittance money to improve economic sustainability.\n",
            "Several policy ideas can help make productive use of remittance money. The first step is introducing NRN savings bonds and dedicated equity funds to mobilise diaspora money into various sectors such as tourism, handicrafts, IT, manufacturing and farming ventures.\n",
            "In this regard, easing foreign exchange controls and allowing dollar accounts could provide further incentives for investments beyond the consumption spending of remittances. The government should also encourage remittances through proper channels and discourage informal hundis. Nepal can learn from Bangladesh,\n",
            "which incentivises expatriates to send remittances through legal channels by offering a five per cent reward\n",
            ".\n",
            "Secondly, the government should promote matching grant partnerships through local agencies. In this scenario, village cooperatives would receive two/three times more funding than collective remittance schemes for growth-centric projects such as eco-tourism, tea or ginger farming, and micro-hydropower, among others. This scheme can create an emotional bond between the diaspora and native communities, aiding in their upliftment.\n",
            "Thirdly, aligning skills development and vocational training programs with overseas job market needs and providing entrepreneurship possibilities can significantly increase employability, family incomes, and remittances. This, in turn, can help more households achieve financial stability.\n",
            "It is essential to have transparent, efficient, and accountable institutions and governance to ensure a steady flow of remittances. The Nepal government could potentially collaborate with Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu University, and NRN to share knowledge and research outcomes. Such an alliance could help develop an appropriate program focused on the best utilization of remittance money.\n",
            "Migration will continue to play a crucial role in Nepal’s national growth story for the next couple of decades. However, it is vital to have strategic policies that effectively utilise remittances for investment purposes. To achieve sustainable growth, Nepal should invest remittance money in the next generation of exporters, businesses, and agricultural ventures instead of using it for current consumption.\n",
            "As the Nepali overseas community grows each year, it is necessary to adopt a diaspora-powered framework that facilitates contributions through institutional reforms. By seizing global opportunities and using income to promote national progress, Nepal’s landscape can be transformed significantly in just a few years. The Nepal government, political leaders, and NRN leadership, regardless of political party affiliation, need to rise above populist isolationism and create a supportive environment that encourages productivity both at home and abroad.\n",

            "Despite starting his singing journey at a young age, Dhakal’s professional musical career officially started in 1990 with the release of his debut single Hamro Sundar Sansar Thiyo. It was the release of his album Asha in 1999 that solidified his status as a household name, particularly with the success of his song Orali Lageko, which propelled him to fame. From that point onward, Dhakal’s career soared to greater heights, as he sat on the top of the Nepali music scene with no competition.\n",
            "Ram Krishna Dhakal has 18 albums and over 5,000 songs. His success has been such that there has even been a biopic made about his career.

The novel challenges us to question the very foundations of our aspirations, encouraging us to look beyond the superficial definitions of a fulfilled life. It invites us to explore the possibility that our preconceived notions of happiness may be limiting our potential for genuine, lasting joy.\n",
            "Coelho’s narrative serves as a mirror, reflecting the silent discontent that many harbours within themselves. The unspoken sadness, even unbeknownst to those who carry it, is palpable in their eyes. This leads us to question whether the societal constructs of success and happiness have blinded us to the possibility of finding fulfilment in simpler, more personal pursuits.\n",
            "In a world where the pursuit of fame and success often dictates the course of our lives, The Zahir challenges us to break free from these chains. It encourages us to explore happiness beyond the conventional markers of accomplishment—beyond the relentless climb up the professional ladder and the societal pressure to conform to predefined norms.\n",
            "So, are we slaves to fame and success? The novel invites us to emancipate ourselves from these perceived shackles, urging us to embark on a journey of self-discovery. Happiness, it suggests, may lie not in external validations but in the authenticity of our pursuits and the fulfilment of our true desires.\n",
            "As we reflect on Coelho’s words, let us pause to consider our own lives. Are we content with the narrative we are living, or is it time to rewrite our stories, embracing the pursuit of happiness on our terms?\n",
            "In the end, The Zahir whispers to us, inviting us to cast off the chains that bind us, to rediscover happiness in the uncharted territories of our hearts.\n",

            "The Redmi A series for the price range has been quite popular over the years. Redmi generally provides two variants in the A series, a normal option and a (+) option like the Redmi A and the Redmi A1+ and the Redmi A2 and the Redmi A2+. In both options, the difference is the availability of the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The (+) option here gets the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.\n",
            "The A3 on the other hand has got a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and other major upgrades.\n",
            "Let us see what the smartphone offers in terms of specs.\n",
            "The Redmi A3 has a new and refreshed design from its predecessors the Redmi A1 and the A2 which shared the same design. The A3 now has a large centrally located rounded camera module in black colour. The camera module has the main camera in the centre followed by the auxiliary lens and the flash on the side. The back of the smartphone is made up of plastic with a glossy finish for the Midnight Black and the Lake Blue colour options whereas the Olive Green colour option gets a bit fancier with the eco-friendly vega leather back. The frame is also made up of plastic with rounded edges and a shiny finish.\n",
            "On the front, the smartphone has a water-drop notch for the selfie camera. The bezels are decent for the price range. It uses an IPS LCD panel with a screen size of 6.7-inch. It has a resolution of 1,650 x 720 pixels with a pixel density of about 268 ppi. It has a 90Hz refresh rate with a screen-to-body ratio of about 83 per cent.\n",
            "The front of the Redmi A3 is protected with the help of Gorilla Glass 3 for accidental drops and scratches. The overall screen performance and viewing are nice in the price range.\n",
            "The Redmi A3 under the hood packs the MediaTek Helio G36 chipset, giving it decent performance for everyday tasks. Its octa-core CPU combines both power and efficiency, with four cores running at 2.2 GHz and four at 1.6 GHz. Graphics are handled by the PowerVR GE8320 GPU, offering smooth visuals for casual gaming and media consumption. It runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, and it provides a user-friendly experience optimized for lower-end devices.\n",
            "The smartphone has three RAM options 3GB, 4GB and 6GB. The 3GB RAM is paired with a 64GB storage option whereas the 4GB and 6GB options are paired with 128GB of storage. It also has a dedicated MicroSD card slot that supports up to 1TB of external storage. The 6GB RAM option also gets a virtual RAM feature to add 6GB more RAM using the internal storage.\n",
            "As for the camera, the Redmi A3 borrows the same setup as its predecessors. The rear camera includes an 8MP main camera which is supported by an 0.08 MP auxiliary lens. The camera output is decent for the price range. It can record 1080p videos at 30fps. As for selfies, it has a 5MP selfie camera which also clicks decent photos and videos. Being a budget-friendly option, the camera specs can be justified.\n",
            "The Redmi A3 has a 5,000 mAh battery, providing long-lasting power for all-day usage. Charging is steady with its 10W wired charging capability. It has Wi-Fi supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections with compatible devices. With 4G network support and dual SIM capability, staying connected is hassle-free. Audio is delivered through its mono speaker or 3.5mm headphone jack. It is equipped with essential sensors like an accelerometer, ambient light, and proximity sensors, along with a convenient side-mounted fingerprint sensor for secure unlocking.\n",
            "It is available in Midnight Black, Lake Blue, and Olive Green colour options.\n",
            "The features of the Redmi A3 are as follows:\n",
            "The Redmi A3 is expected to cost Rs 12,500 for the 3/64GB option, Rs 14,500 for the 4/128GB option and Rs 16,500 for the 6/128GB option in Nepal.\n",
            "The Redmi A series has become very popular in its price segment. Other smartphones in the same price segment from other companies do not provide the number of specs and features Redmi has provided. However, there can be a few major improvements in the Redmi A4 in the charging department with support for at least 15W and a camera department with a depth sensor instead of an Auxiliary sensor. Other than that, the Redmi A3 can continue its dominance in the budget market with the A series.\n",

            "While most of us have heard about the four martyrs of Nepal, many school curriculums only touch upon their stories superficially without delving into the details of their lives, struggles, and sacrifices. However, the Ganga Lal, directed and written by Che Shankar, aims to fill this gap, focusing specifically on the life of martyr Ganga Lal Shrestha, who was murdered by the Rana regime when he was only 22.\n",

            "Christopher Columbus\n",
            ".  This initial scene might prompt confusion among the audience as they may wonder why Columbus, a historical figure associated with exploration, is featured in a play that aims to tell the story of Ganga Lal Shrestha.\n",
            "This was a deliberate ploy by the makers as Ganga Lal loved acting and is known to have taken on roles such as Julius Caesar and Christopher Columbus during his youth. By showing this, the makers aimed to show Ganga Lal as a multifaceted individual with diverse interests and talents.\n",
            "“Shrestha was also the youngest martyr and all these factors about him inspired us to highlight his story,” says Che Shankar, writer and director of the play.\n",
            "In the sense that follows, Ganga Lal is seen in conversation with Dashrath Chand there they talk about overthrowing the oppressive Rana regime. It is clear from their conversation how the Ranas have tortured the locals and infringed upon their fundamental rights including freedom of expression, education, and others.\n",
            "The strength of Ganga Lal, however, lies in its plot and the performances of its actors.\n",
            "While there have been various theatrical productions addressing different historical contexts in Nepal, plays focusing on the stories of martyrs and their struggle against the Rana regime are rare.\n",
            "This is what Ganga Lal has tried to do as it shows the struggle of the general public and sheds light on crucial aspects of Nepal’s past while also resonating with contemporary audiences.\n",
            "The suffering that the general public went through during the Rana regime, is unimaginable for the people of contemporary times. If you were not a royalty or those close to them, you were not allowed to study. What was even worse than speaking against them could get people killed.\n",
            "While Ganga Lal primarily focuses on the life of Ganga Lal Shrestha, it also illustrates the contributions of the other three martyrs. The play highlights that without the collective efforts of these four martyrs, the downfall of the Rana regime in the country would not have been possible.\n",
            "Similarly, the production highlights the pivotal role played by Ganesh Man Singh in ending the Rana regime. The scene depicting the secret meeting between the four martyrs and Ganesh Man Singh, where they discuss their plans against the Ranas, adds an extra layer of captivation to the play.\n",
            "There are 13 actors in the show and each one of them has done a commendable job. However, Nirbhik Bhattarai, who has performed the role of Ganga Lal Shrestha, steals the show. His powerful dialogue, in a Newa accent—which sounds very natural, deserves special appreciation.\n",
            "Bhattarai’s powerful dialogue delivery will surely send shivers down your spine and ignite a nationalistic feeling.\n",
            "The makers also worked hard in its presentation. The play’s simple setting with just a full moon above and fog transitions is visually appealing.\n",
            "In terms of music, a recorded instrumental track accompanies the live choir performances by the actors. The rendition of Siddhicharan Shrestha’s poem Jiunu Haena, Marna Rojchu at the play’s conclusion is executed wonderfully, adding a memorable touch to the production.\n",
            "Ganga Lal is highly recommended watch for everyone, especially for school students, as it will be a great opportunity for them to learn about the country’s history differently.\n",
            "History is often viewed as a dull subject by many school students, but Ganga Lal is an exception. It not only recounts the country’s past but also educates people about the sacrifices of martyrs and what it means to be one.\n",
            "Gangalal will run through January 12 every day at 5:00 pm at Shilpee Theatre, Battisputali, Kathmandu. There will be an additional show on Saturday at 1:00 pm.\n",

When you look at the painting close up you will not notice any figure, you will just see blobs of different hues of yellow, black, red and more in acrylic colour.

            "“Together, the works of Ranjit and Greby offer a profound exploration of colour alchemy, where each stroke of the brush manifests enchantment and invites viewers to witness the mystical dance of colours on canvases,” adds Lama.\n",
            "Ranjit’s abstract paintings showcase the blend of light and dark through hues where they move in different directions forming a scenario of dance. He uses vibrant and soft hues such as pink, green, and blue along with red, black grey and more. He hopes that the viewers of his paintings can contemplate the use of colours and motions in their journeys, interactions or interpretations within his paintings.\n",
            "Moreover, Greby’s paintings are inspired by his experiences living between Nepal, Korea and France. He believes his paintings are his self-representation and that paintings should evoke universal feelings that transcend cultural and linguistic barriers.\n",
            "In his paintings, viewers can see the use of minimal colours and motifs. He has used ocher tones in his painting and has a sense of harmony. In his painting ‘Self-portrait’, using minimal lines and circles on an ocher-toned background, he has created a portrait of himself in a ghostly or mysterious manner.\n",

            "role of pandits\n",
            ". Over time, there has been a gradual decline in interest and awareness about the significance of Hindu rituals, leading to a diminishing role and value of Hindu priests, known as pandits.\n",
            "Today people are more inclined to the Western lifestyle and the ancient Hindu tradition is fading in the background. This phenomenon can lead to a crisis in the future of Hindu society and the upcoming generation.\n",
            "In the hustle and bustle of modern society, the spiritual aspect that binds the society and community is gradually facing a crisis. The rituals and knowledge that were once the backbone of society are now becoming a thing of the past or an old-school activity that is being ignored.\n",
            "The intention and value of the Hindu religion along with its rituals are designed to encourage a disciplined, healthy lifestyle and well-being of individuals. Similarly, it also encourages the feeling of gratitude, and selflessness awakening the sense of contribution. These practices are the factors that our society was based upon.\n",
            "The pandits have a crucial role in upholding and continuing cultural, religious and spiritual practice. However, their contribution often remains unnoticed.\n",
            "It may lead to a crisis of practices and values in our society as our society and nation are built upon our cultural practices and traditions. Gone were the days when even political decisions in this nation used to be taken under the references of shastras.\n",
            "It is time to understand that our society is all about our culture, religion and spirituality which makes us different and rich from the world.\n",
            "While the spiritual and religious guidance rendered by pandits are invaluable, their economic status is often overlooked.\n",
            "Pandits are found to receive low payment and as a result, they are facing financial challenges. According to our tradition, pandits have to guide the yajaman (client) on their every spiritual and religious practice and in return the yajaman are supposed to look after their (pandits) needs.\n",
            "However, with time this practice has vanished, which has affected their livelihood making them struggle economically. When they have to struggle with everyday needs, this compels them to change their mindset about the effort and devotion they put into their roles and responsibilities.\n",
            "This condition has posed a threat to the profession of pandit.\n",
            "Another problem that should be critically noticed is the prevailing assumption of people that the importance of pandits is declining in the modern era.\n",
            "Culturally, pandits are considered the most important position. They were placed next to the place of god in the Hindu religion. As societal values are changing and evolving, there is a growing gap between the importance of rituals and how they perceive their significance in our society.\n",
            "This, as a result, discourages potential successors from embracing the sacred and divine profession, paving the way for a potential shortage of qualified pandits in the years to come.\n",
            "It is a strong call for the community and society to acknowledge the invaluable contribution and importance of pandits.\n",
            "If proper action and efforts are not made timely we may lose this sacred profession in future days and the divinity of this profession. Future generations might face the scarcity of guides for performing their rituals and traditions.\n",
            "Some things can be done immediately to address the existing problems of pandits. Firstly, organising and conducting programmes to educate and aware the younger generation about the cultural and spiritual importance of Hindu rituals.\n",
            "Secondly, advocating for the fair payment of the pandits to ensure their economic stability. This will help them to remain focused on the spiritual aspects of the rituals rather than their survival insecurities.\n",
            "Moreover, it is also important to encourage the active participation of society in religious and spiritual events to raise a sense of belonging and shared responsibility. In spirituality, more engagement leads to a greater sense of awareness and responsibility.\n",

Recognizing this, long-time friends Anup Satyal and Bikranta Malla envisioned making a meaningful impact in the data sector in the country.\n",

            "Upon their return, they observed a growing demand for information regarding Covid among the general public. Identifying this need, they assembled a small team skilled in data analytics and began publicly releasing data and reports on Covid cases visually. Their efforts garnered attention, and soon, the general public began expressing interest in their work, eagerly anticipating further contributions from them.\n",
            "“This made us realise that there is an opportunity in data analytics in Nepal, and then we started Xabit Analytics in 2021,” says Satyal, co-founder of Xabit Analytics.\n",
            "Based in Putalisadak, Kathmandu, Xabit Analytics is a company that integrates, analyses and utilises data.  Besides the three above-mentioned works, the company also helps its clients in decision-making and implementation.\n",
            "According to Satyal, Xabit Analytics is more than a technical company that provides data reports. He says that for them, data serves as a tool through which they advise their clients on decision-making and implementation strategies.\n",
            "“We are the only company that does this in Nepal. There were before us but none of them are in operation anymore,” he says.\n",
            "Since its operation, Xabit Analytics has worked with six clients, with the majority being outsourced partnerships. There are several reasons behind the relatively smaller number of Nepali clients.\n",
            "“Although everyone at the executive level understands the importance of data they are reluctant to invest,” says Satyal.  “Nepali companies have still not been able to understand the process of making data useful, and have failed to value the data.”\n",
            "What also creates a problem is Nepali businesses seeking immediate results.\n",
            "“When they don’t understand that it takes time, it becomes hard to work with them,” says Satyal.\n",
            "This is why Xabit Analytics likes working with foreign companies compared to Nepali ones.\n",
            "“Communication is clear with foreign clients. They provide us with what they want and give us the data but in Nepal things are different,” says Satyal.\n",
            "Nepali companies do not have clear goals and the necessary data, says Satyal.\n",
            "“The data teams of some companies are also reluctant to accept our analytics and are uncooperative. They act as if we are there to take their jobs,” he says.\n",
            "As a result, the results of data analytics have not been up to the mark. But there are signs of change.\n",
            "The people working at Xabit Analytics are predominantly young graduates. Interestingly, Xabit Analytics does not specifically seek out candidates with bachelor’s or master’s degrees in data science.\n",
            "“We prioritise individuals with strong analytical capabilities,” says Satyal. “We prefer fresh graduates or young professionals, as Nepali companies are in the developing stages of data analytics, requiring less intense work.”\n",

            "Xabit Analytics\n",

This is why, whenever they have the opportunity, Xabit Analytics takes the initiative to educate their clients and the general public that personal or personally identifiable information is not required for analytics purposes. By doing so, they ensure strict adherence to privacy standards and promote a better understanding of ethical data practices.\n",
            "“There is a misunderstanding among the people regarding data analytics. People think that we need personal or personally identifiable data for data analytics, but that is not true,” says Satyal. “For instance, if we are doing the data analytics of a coffee shop, the coffee shop can just provide us the sales details of their items, without disclosing their real name.”\n",
            "How long does it take to analyse data? That depends on the data’s quality, says Satyal.\n",
            "“It can take a day or even months and years,” he says.\n",
            "Xabit Analytics dedicates the initial three months to cleaning the data, followed by an additional few months to derive actionable insights and generate reports.\n",
            "Xabit Analytics primarily focuses on two major industries: retail and fintech. Satyal mentions that they have substantial experience in these sectors, particularly due to his expertise in them.\n",

            "All living beings are born into the world, but the discrimination faced by females at birth is not just a problem in the hilly regions of Nepal; it is a significant issue in the Madhesh region of Nepal.\n",
            "When a family welcomes their first baby girl, they try to express joy. However, if a woman gives birth to a second or third female child, family members may harbour negative feelings towards the mother. Discrimination against the girl child and the mother becomes evident.\n",
            "In many cases, family members express disappointment when informed that the upcoming baby is a girl. Unfortunately, this discrimination can even lead to harmful practices, such as gender-based prenatal sex determination, where families may consider avoiding or terminating the pregnancy if the unborn child is identified as a girl.\n",
            "This has resulted in a higher incidence of prenatal deaths for baby girls. There are 1,290,525 male children and 1,148,758 female children aged 0–4 in the country. The female population is 1,41,767 less than the male population.\n",
            "Education is an equal opportunity for both males and females, but girls often face significant discrimination in education. Many families do not treat their sons and daughters equally when it comes to educational opportunities.\n",
            "While boys may have the chance to attend private schools, girls are often limited to government schools. In middle-class families, boys may have opportunities for higher-level education outside the village, but girls often do not receive the same opportunities.\n",
            "In the Madhesh region, many girls are married off after completing their Secondary Education Examination School Certificate (SEE) or grade 12 education. Unfortunately, families below the poverty line often do not provide educational opportunities for girls.\n",
            "According to the\n",
            "National Statistics Office,\n",
            "the literacy rate in Nepal is 76.2 per cent, with males at 83.6 per cent and females at 69.4 per cent. The female literacy rate is 14.2 per cent lower than the male literacy rate. The literacy rate in the Madhesh Province is lower than in the other six provinces. The literacy rate in Madhesh Province is 63.5 per cent, with males at 72.5 per cent and females at 54.7 per cent.\n",
            "Moreover, healthcare discrimination is a serious issue that affects many Nepali women. They may have difficulty accessing quality health care due to several factors, including poverty, lack of education, and lack of access to transportation.\n",
            "In addition, Nepali women are often more likely to experience discrimination and mistreatment when seeking medical treatment, which can further discourage them from seeking the care they need. According to the United Nations, globally, a woman dies every two minutes due to pregnancy or childbirth-related complications.\n",
            "In 1996, Nepal’s maternal mortality rate was 539 per 100,000 live births and in 2016, it was 239 per 100,000 live births which shows the slow progress in maternal health in Nepal.\n",
            "Violence against women\n",
            "is one of the major issues in Nepal. According to the Women Rehabilitation Centre, the total number of registered incidents is 1,175, including 179 cases of domestic violence, 179 cases of rape, 115 cases of sexual abuse, 25 cases of human trafficking, 69 cases of child marriage, 47 cases of dowry-related violence, 24 cases of witchcraft allegations, and 130 cases of polygamy.\n",
            "The highest incidence of domestic violence is reported in Koshi Province with 358 cases, and the highest number of rape cases, 72, is also in Koshi Province, surpassing other forms of violence. Child marriage is more prevalent in Koshi Province with 28 cases. Meanwhile, sexual abuse, dowry-related violence, witchcraft allegations, and polygamy are also higher in Madhesh province with 54, 25, 10, and 47 cases respectively.\n",
            "The\n",
            "2015 Constitution\n",
            "mandates that at least one woman be included in the nation’s highest positions, including President or Vice-President, Speaker or Deputy Speaker, and Chair or Vice-Chair of the National Assembly.\n",
            "At the municipality level, at least one of the mayor and deputy mayor positions must be filled by a woman. At the local level, women hold at least 40 per cent of all top political positions. In Nepal, there are 753 local governments. However, in the 2022 election, there were 25 Mayors/Chairs, 562 Deputy Mayors/Vice-Chairs, and 69 Ward Chairs.\n",
            "Women holding these positions are a ray of hope for the women. However, Nepal is a patriarchal society and these women may face challenges in making significant decisions without consulting their husbands or male figures from their households.\n",
            "Likewise, Nepali women face numerous restrictions on their freedom. This can include societal norms and expectations that limit their choices and opportunities, as well as legal barriers that discriminate against them.\n",
            "These restrictions can make it difficult for women to participate fully in society and make their own decisions. The government and society need to address these issues and work towards\n",
            "equality\n",
            "and inclusion for women.\n",
            "This can include implementing laws and policies to protect women’s rights, as well as changing cultural attitudes. However, the lack of women’s freedom should be addressed before completing their education. Many girls are forced into marriage due to this lack of freedom.\n",
            "In such cases, parents make decisions about their future. Advocating for women’s rights and empowerment is crucial for a more equitable society. Overall, gender discrimination in Nepal is a widespread and persistent problem that affects women and girls across the country.\n",

            "Nepal and its art scene for the longest time has been influenced by its deeply rooted and nuanced fragments of culture and history. But, with the modern wave of the internet globalising everything, the contemporary Nepali art scene has been met with a whole new array of disciplines.\n",
            "To give context to what a discipline is in art, artistic disciplines are the various categories through which art can be done. From literature to performance art, each fragment of expression is a discipline of art. No matter how it is done, as long as an expression is there – art and a discipline of art can exist.\n",
            "A good example of a discipline in art can be\n",
            "abstract art\n",
            ", a term many of us are familiar with. Another example could be\n",
            "sculpture art\n",
            "(where stones are carved into pieces, and pieces are shined into representations & statues).\n",
            "Though as subjective as disciplines in art is, through a month-long interview and research on the underground art scene of Kathmandu and Lalitpur, I found that around four such disciplines have been garnering an audience and an emergence.\n",
            "Most of the Art in Nepal (until now) has been significantly inspired and birthed by old traditional culture itself. Disciplines such as\n",
            "Thangka painting\n",
            ", wood carving, dhokra art and textile art disciplines have been the most influential disciplines until now. But, with this modern resurgence of globalisation, acceptance, and a new generation of art-doing, a renaissance through modernism and Western culture might be hitting the Nepali art scene.\n",
            "Through my research and interviews with some of the most influential artists in the scene (of the contemporary), what I found was that four of such art disciplines are surging and emerging from this subjective modern renaissance in the Nepali art scene.\n",
            "Contemporary blending into traditional art is an artistic discipline that combines modern artistic techniques and concepts with traditional methods and themes, resulting in innovative and culturally rich creations. This artistic discipline finds a way to blend the old way of doing art with modernistic practices and creates a blend of the past and the present world.\n",
            "To give context to it traditional art shifted from the religious to the secular in the mid-19th century, with the rise of the Shahs and Ranas. This marked a huge turn of development in the contemporary world of art in Nepal. But with this modern wave of renaissance, traditional artists such as Abhi (Abhijeet Prajapati) have been using modern elements to define traditionality and culture, indulging in this new practice of an artistic discipline.\n",
            "Institutions like the Nepal Art Council and the Weltmuseum Wien (among many) have played a vital role in the promotion, welfare and platform-giving of this discipline of blending contemporary and modernism into traditional art.\n",
            "With up-and-coming artists such as Dotts (Nikhil Bahadur Shakya) using this form of an emerging artistic discipline, this new discipline seems to be the most growing and accepted form of discipline in the Nepali art scene.\n",
            "Graffiti and street art\n",
            "though, these two words are used interchangeably and have different meanings. Graffiti typically refers to unauthorised markings or scribbles, while street art encompasses a broader range of artistic expressions, often with a purpose or message. Moreover, Graffiti has become a powerful form of urban expression that has shaped the visual landscape and cultural identity of communities worldwide.\n",
            "Graffiti as an art form and an inscription into canvas painting, or even the culture of street art as a discipline in art itself seems to be on the rise. And not just in the walls of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur but also in the form of canvas paintings graffiti and street art as a discipline is on the rise.\n",
            "With the new generation of modern graffiti writers like Mr.Do, impacting the emergence of street art, and graffiti as a discipline in art itself, this genre of discipline is getting a huge wave of attraction, comradery, validation and respect in the Nepali art scene.\n",
            "Projection Mapping\n",
            "is a new and emerging discipline in art that utilises imagery and light to convey ideas, narratives, or aesthetics, often in various mediums and contexts. Projection maps can be used as an assistive way of artistic expression in concerts and shows, to give them an alluring and almost a psychedelic feel.\n",
            "Through lights, software and sculptures of the LED, this discipline of art is a great example of how art does not shy away from modern technology and through its use, can even be enhanced. Digital artwork, animation and illustrations made through the assistance of technologies, and using such illustrations as an art piece, to immerse viewers more just shows how many possibilities there are for the facets of art to emerge into new disciplines.\n",
            "In Nepal, two notable institutions that have been able to promote this discipline of art are Gallery Mcube and Artudio. With multidisciplinary artists like Box (Bidhan Bajracharya), who are inclined towards graphic design, illustration, and street art, embracing and promoting projection mapping as an emerging discipline, a small yet burgeoning culture and community have formed around it in the art world.\n",
            "Surrealism\n",
            "is a discipline in art that dives into the realms of the subconscious and the irrational, often portraying dream-like imagery and fantasy-like elements to evoke emotions and provoke thoughts in the viewer. At its core, surrealism, stemming from the avant-garde movement of the 20th century, revolves around the exploration of artistic and illustrative divergence.\n",
            "Surrealism in Nepal has been embraced by multidisciplinary artists such as Ryan (Sushant Shree Rajbhandari) as a medium through which he can express his almost transcendental, dream-like, kafkaesque way of world-building.\n",
            "With pioneers of this art form such as\n",
            "Lain Singh Bangdel\n",
            ", whose surrealist art pieces lie in\n",
            "Bikalpa Art Center\n",
            "and Park Gallery, this contemporary and nuanced discipline of art does seem to be an emerging discipline in Nepal.\n",
            "Each artist has their very own way of expression and without a doubt through this new wave of modernism in the disciplines of doing art in Nepal, other different facets will arise. And, usually as a narrow-minded society, ‘new and difference’ is seen as something bad or wrong.\n",
            "Differences should not be criticised but rather encouraged. To each their very own way of doing art, and to them, their very own ways of expression. But, though indifference can be dealt with through knowledge and awareness, a lack of a platform for all Nepali artists lies as an underlying problem.\n",
            "With this modern renaissance and resurgence in viewership of art in Nepal, it is time for institutions and platform-givers to step up and provide a space of acceptance for these new disciplines of art in Nepal that have emerged. Only then can modern artists in Nepal find solace.\n",
